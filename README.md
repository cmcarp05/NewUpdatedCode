## Introduction

The Fuel Efficiency Data Analytics Platform is a web application designed to automatically gather, process, and present the most recent fuel efficiency statistics for various fuel types, providing users with insightful analytics in a user-friendly UI.

## Changes and Progress

### Updated Flask Application

- Set up a basic Flask server in `app.py`.
- Integrated Kaggle API to download datasets directly from Kaggle.
- Handled authentication for the Kaggle API using the `kaggle.json` file.

### Data Processing

- Implemented a function to retrieve the fuel economy dataset from Kaggle.
- Used Pandas to read the CSV data into a DataFrame.

### Frontend Development

- Created a basic HTML template to display the data.
- Utilized Bootstrap to style the frontend for a responsive design.
- Added custom CSS to enhance the visual appearance of the data presentation.

### Troubleshooting and Debugging

- Ensured that the `kaggle` package was correctly installed and imported.
- Verified that the `kaggle.json` file was located in the correct directory with the right permissions.
- Addressed issues with Flask not displaying data by confirming the data was correctly passed to the template.
- Debugged CSS linking issues to ensure that the custom styles were applied.

## Next Steps

- Implement additional data visualization using Chart.js or D3.js.
- Add user interactivity with dropdown menus, filters, and comparison functionalities.
